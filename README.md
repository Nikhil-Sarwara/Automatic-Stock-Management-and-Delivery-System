Here’s a nice-looking `README.md` template for your **Automatic Stock Management and Delivery System** project. You can adapt this template to fit the specifics of your implementation.

# 📦 Automatic Stock Management and Delivery System

Welcome to the **Automatic Stock Management and Delivery System** project! This system is designed to automate the inventory and delivery processes for supermarkets, making stock management efficient, accurate, and seamless.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Inventory Tracking**: Automatically monitors stock levels.
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Notifies store managers when stock is low.
- **Automated Restocking**: Integrates with suppliers for automatic restocking.
- **Order Management**: Handles order placements and updates inventory in real-time.
- **Delivery Scheduling**: Automatically schedules deliveries and optimizes routes.
- **Delivery Tracking**: Real-time tracking of delivery status.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Provides insights into stock trends, sales data, and delivery performance.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](./System%20Architecture.png)

The system is composed of three main components:

1. **Inventory Management System (IMS)** - Monitors stock levels and handles supplier integration.
2. **Order Management System (OMS)** - Manages orders and updates stock accordingly.
3. **Delivery Management System (DMS)** - Optimizes and tracks deliveries.

Each component is designed to communicate with the central database and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system.

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (depending on your tech stack)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-stock-management.git
cd automatic-stock-management
```

### Install Dependencies

For a Node.js-based system:

```bash
npm install
```

<!--
For a Python-based system:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` -->

### Set Up the Database

Create a new database in MySQL/PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE stock_management;
```

### Run the System

For Node.js:

```bash
npm start
```

For Python:

```bash
python app.py
```

## 🔍 Usage

1. **Manage Inventory**: Log in as a manager to view real-time stock levels, set reorder points, and check pending orders.
2. **Place Orders**: Use the order module to place new orders, automatically adjusting inventory levels.
3. **Track Deliveries**: Schedule deliveries and track them using the delivery module's interface.

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
pytest
```

## 🖼️ Screenshots

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted.
- Authentication is required for accessing management functions.
- Regular security audits and updates are applied to ensure safety.

## 📅 Roadmap

- [x] Implement basic inventory management.
- [x] Integrate order management and real-time updates.
- [ ] Add advanced analytics and reporting.
- [ ] Implement machine learning for demand forecasting.
- [ ] Mobile app integration.
